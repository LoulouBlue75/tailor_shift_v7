## The Problem We Solve

### For Brands

Hiring in luxury retail is broken:

- **CV overload** — Hundreds of applications, no way to filter for true expertise
- **Salary mismatch** — Weeks into interviews, discover budget doesn't align
- **Soft skill blindspots** — Hard to assess clienteling ability, cultural fit, or leadership potential from a resume
- **Time waste** — Hiring managers spend 60%+ of time on unqualified candidates

### For Talents

The job search is exhausting:

- **Privacy concerns** — Sharing salary expectations feels risky and transactional
- **Irrelevant opportunities** — Constantly pitched roles that don't match experience or goals
- **Black box process** — No visibility into why applications are rejected
- **One-dimensional perception** — Reduced to job titles, not true capabilities

## Our Unique Value Proposition

### What We Do Differently

| Traditional Platforms | TailorShift |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Match on job title & keywords | Match on **8 dimensions** of competency + fit |
| Ask for salary ranges upfront | Calculate **alignment silently** — no numbers exposed |
| Surface hundreds of applicants | Deliver **pre-qualified shortlists** |
| Treat talents as resumes | Treat talents as **complete professionals** |

### The TailorShift Difference

We don't just connect people. We **calculate fit**.

Our algorithm evaluates every match across **8 dimensions**—from product expertise to leadership potential, from location flexibility to compensation alignment. The result? Brands see only candidates who genuinely match. Talents see only opportunities where they belong.

**No wasted interviews. No awkward salary surprises. Just precision.**

## 8D Matching: Simplified

### What Are the 8 Dimensions?

We assess compatibility across eight factors that actually matter in luxury retail hiring:

### The Benefit-Driven Explanation

**For marketers and external communication:**

> "Our 8D Matching Algorithm looks at the full picture—not just where you've worked, but what you're great at, where you want to go, and whether the opportunity is the right fit financially. Think of it as a compatibility score, built specifically for luxury retail."

**Simplified tagline:**

> *"8 dimensions. One perfect match."*

### How to Talk About It

✅ **DO say:**
- "We evaluate fit across 8 dimensions"
- "Our algorithm matches on competencies, not just keywords"
- "Every candidate is assessed for role, location, and budget alignment"

❌ **DON'T say:**
- Technical jargon like "weighted scoring" or "JSONB columns"
- "We use AI" (our algorithm is deterministic, not AI-driven)
- "We score people" (focus on fit, not judgment)

---

## Feature Spotlight: Compensation Alignment

### The Challenge

Salary is the elephant in every interview room. Both sides waste weeks only to discover fundamental misalignment. But asking for numbers upfront feels invasive and transactional.

### Our Solution: Privacy-First Alignment

TailorShift calculates compensation fit **without exposing actual figures**.

│  ✅ Brands DO see: Alignment status only                  │
│                                                             │

### The Alignment Badges

| Badge | Meaning | What It Tells the Brand |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| 🟢 **Within range** | Expectations match budget | Proceed with confidence |
| 🟡 **Above range** (+X%) | Expectations exceed budget | Consider if flex exists |
| 🔵 **Below range** | Expectations under budget | Rare, but good news |
| ⚪ **Unknown** | Data not provided | Ask during conversation |

### How to Talk About Compensation Alignment

✅ **DO say:**
- "We match on compensation fit—brands see alignment, not your numbers"
- "Know before you apply if the budget works for you"
- "No awkward salary negotiations at the end of the process"
- "Your expectations stay private. Alignment doesn't."

❌ **DON'T say:**
- "We share salary data with employers"
- "We score candidates by salary"
- "Your compensation affects your match score" (it doesn't—it's a separate signal)

### The Messaging Angle

> **For talents:** *"Share your expectations. Keep your privacy. We show brands whether you're a fit—not what you make."*

> **For brands:** *"Stop wasting time on candidates outside your budget. Our alignment badges tell you instantly if compensation works—without seeing their numbers."*
